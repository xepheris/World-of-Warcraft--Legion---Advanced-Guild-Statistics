# World-of-Warcraft--Legion---Advanced-Guild-Statistics

STILL WORK IN PROGRESS! This is a complete rewritten version of the currently still running http://guild.artifactpower.info.

Allows import of whole guilds or just single characters of a specific guild by selection and helps tracking core statistics of the game, allowing both performance improvements for single players as well as overall raid improvements by easing loot distribution and decision making.

Based more or less completely in PHP.

Optimized for top 5% guilds - at least heroic content should be progressed.
Optimized as well for evening/night players color-wise.
Optimized for desktop browsers with at least 1980x1080 resolution.
